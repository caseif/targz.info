# targz.info
targz.info is a website I made as a cheatsheet for the tar command. This is mostly for personal use, as I find myself
having to look up the usage or run the `--help` flag almost every time I use it, but hopefully others will find use in
it as well. :)

As always, [relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1168).
